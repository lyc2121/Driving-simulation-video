This is the Driving simulation videos

there are 18 volunteers to drive in a simulated environment that had a camera with a similar position, distance, and lighting conditions to real vehicles. Eighteen different volunteers perform 18 videos, and they contain two different scenes: daytime driving with masks, and nighttime driving with masks. Each video lasted 1.5 hours, and each volunteer was asked to drive on the same roads with monotonous surroundings where people get drowsy quickly. To obtain the real state of drivers, we used the NeuroSky TGAM EEG acquisition module to collect the brainwave information.
